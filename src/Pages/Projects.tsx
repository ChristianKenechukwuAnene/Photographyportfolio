            This photograph was captured using a Samsung Galaxy S22, a device known for its sharp detail and excellent dynamic range, 
            which allowed me to beautifully capture the calm and reflective atmosphere of the moment. 
            I chose a longer focal length to create a soft, dreamy look—compressing the background slightly
            while keeping the composition balanced with both the environment and the subject in harmony.
             Because the lighting was natural and gentle, I kept the aperture wide to let more light into the camera,
              ensuring the scene remained bright and clear without losing its softness. Using a handheld shot, 
              I selected a shutter speed fast enough to avoid motion blur while still maintaining a natural flow of light.
               The low ISO helped keep the image smooth and noise-free, preserving the peaceful mood of the scene.

          <p>
           In contemporary discourse, sustainability is often associated with environmental
            protection and resource management. However, true sustainability extends beyond
             ecological systems; it includes social structures, emotional wellbeing, and
              equitable participation. Social sustainability asks an essential question:
               how can societies create environments where individuals feel valued, included,
                and connected? You Are a Note responds to this question through interactive design.
